Before servicing (including removal or\ninstallation of parts, inspection or replacement), be sure\nto read the following items carefully, then follow the cor-\nrect procedure described in this manual.\n(b)\nGENERAL NOTICE\n(1)\nMalfunction symptoms of the supplemental re-\nstraint system are difficult to confirm, so the diag-\nnostic trouble codes become the most important\nsource of information when troubleshooting. When\ntroubleshooting the supplemental restraint system,\nalways inspect the diagnostic trouble codes before\ndisconnecting the battery (See page DI\u2212240).\n(2)\nWork must be started after 90 seconds from the\ntime the ignition switch is turned to the \u201dLOCK\u201d posi-\ntion and the negative (\u2212) terminal cable is discon-\nnected from the battery.\n(The supplemental restraint system is equipped\nwith a back\u2212up power source so that if work is\nstarted within 90 seconds of disconnecting the neg-\native (\u2212) terminal cable from the battery, the SRS\nmay deploy.)\nWhen the negative (\u2212) terminal cable is discon-\nnected from the battery, memory of the clock and\naudio systems will be cancelled. So before starting\nwork, make a record of the contents memorized by\nthe each memory system. Then when work is fin-\nished, reset the clock and audio systems as before.\nTo avoid erasing the memory of each memory sys-\ntem, never use a back\u2212up power supply from anoth-\ner battery.\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010", "category": "general", "metadata": {"vehicle_type": "fzj80", "pdf": "fzj80_fsm_1996", "pages": "11-12", "part": 1}}

The first function is the Diagnostic\nTrouble Code Check in which a malfunction in the signal circuits to the ECU is stored in code in the ECU\nmemory at the time of occurrence, to be output by the technician during troubleshooting. Another function\nis the Input Signal Check which checks if the signals from various switches are sent to the ECU correctly.\nBy using these check functions, the problem areas can be narrowed down quickly and troubleshooting can\nbe performed effectively. Diagnostic functions are incorporated in the following systems in the LAND CRUIS-\nER.\nSystem\nDiagnostic Trouble\nCode Check\nInput Signal Check\n(Sensor Check)\nDiagnostic Test\nMode (Active Test)\n1.

In addition,\nit must be checked in the problem symptom check whether the malfunction indicated by the diagnostic\ntrouble code is directly related to the problem symptom or not. For this reason, the diagnostic trouble codes\nshould be checked before and after the symptom confirmation to determine the current conditions, as shown\nin the table below. If this is not done, it may, depending on the case, result in unnecessary troubleshooting\nfor normally operating systems, thus making it more difficult to locate the problem, or in repairs not pertinent\nto the problem. Therefore, always follow the procedure in correct order and perform the diagnostic trouble\ncode check.\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010", "category": "general", "metadata": {"vehicle_type": "fzj80", "pdf": "fzj80_fsm_1996", "pages": "22-23", "part": 1}}

In such cases,\na thorough customer problem analysis must be carried out, then simulate the same or similar conditions and\nenvironment in which the problem occurred in the customer\u2019s vehicle. No matter how much experience a\ntechnician has, or how skilled he may be, if he proceeds to troubleshoot without confirming the problem\nsymptoms he will tend to overlook something important in the repair operation and make a wrong guess\nsomewhere, which will only lead to a standstill. For example, for a problem which only occurs when the en-\ngine is cold, or for a problem which occurs due to vibration caused by the road during driving, etc., the prob-\nlem can never be determined so long as the symptoms are confirmed with the engine hot condition or the\nvehicle at a standstill. Since vibration, heat or water penetration (moisture) is likely cause for problem which\nis difficult to reproduce, the symptom simulation tests introduced here are effective measures in that the ex-\nternal causes are applied to the vehicle in a stopped condition.\nImportant Points in the Symptom Simulation Test:\nIn the symptom simulation test, the problem symptoms should of course be confirmed, but the problem area\nor parts must also be found out. To do this, narrow down the possible problem circuits according to the symp-\ntoms before starting this test and connect a tester beforehand. After that, carry out the symptom simulation\ntest, judging whether the circuit being tested is defective or normal and also confirming the problem symp-\ntoms at the same time. Refer to the problem symptoms table for each system to narrow down the possible\ncauses of the symptom.\nFI2331\nFI2332\nFI2330\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010", "category": "electrical", "metadata": {"vehicle_type": "fzj80", "pdf": "fzj80_fsm_1996", "pages": "24-26", "part": 1}}

Accordingly, if diagnosis is per-\nformed without the problem symptoms occurring, refer to\nStep 8 to replace the ECU. So always confirm that the\nproblem symptoms are occurring, or proceed with inspec-\ntion while using the symptom simulation method.\n\u0002\nThe instructions \u201dCheck wire harness and connector\u201d and\n\u201dCheck and replace ECU\u201d which appear in the inspection\nprocedure, are common and applicable to all diagnostic\ntrouble codes. Follow the procedure outlined below\nwhenever these instructions appear.\nOPEN CIRCUIT:\nThis could be due to a disconnected wire harness, faulty con-\ntact in the connector, a connector terminal pulled out, etc.\nHINT:\n\u0002\nIt is rarely the case that a wire is broken in the middle of\nit. Most cases occur at the connector. In particular, care-\nfully check the connectors of sensors and actuators\n\u0002\nFaulty contact could be due to rusting of the connector\nterminals, to foreign materials entering terminals or a de-\nformation of connector terminals. Simply disconnecting\nand reconnecting the connectors once changes the\ncondition of the connection and may result in a return to\nnormal operation. Therefore, in troubleshooting, if no ab-\nnormality is found in the wire harness and connector\ncheck, but the problem disappears after the check, then\nthe cause is considered to be in the wire harness or con-\nnectors.\nSHORT CIRCUIT:\nThis could be due to a contact between wire harness and the\nbody ground or to a short circuit occurred inside the switch, etc.\nHINT:\nWhen there is a short circuit between the wire harness and body\nground, check thoroughly whether the wire harness is caught\nin the body or is clamped properly.\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010", "category": "general", "metadata": {"vehicle_type": "fzj80", "pdf": "fzj80_fsm_1996", "pages": "27-43", "part": 4}}

Sometimes FM stereo broadcasts cannot be\nreceived even through AM can be received in very clearly.\nNot only does FM stereo have the smallest service area, but it\nalso picks up static and other types of interference (\u201dnoise\u201d)\neasily.\n3.\nRECEPTION PROBLEMS\nBesides the problem of static, there are also the problems\ncalled \u201dfading\u201d, \u201dmultipath\u201d and \u201dfade out\u201d. These problems are\ncaused not by electrical noise but by the nature of the radio\nwaves themselves.\n(1)\nFading\nBesides electrical interference, AM broadcasts are\nalso susceptible to other types of interference, es-\npecially at night. This is because AM radio waves\nbounce off the ionosphere at night. These radio\nwaves then interfere with the signals from the same\ntransmitter that reach the vehicle\u2019s antenna directly.\nThis type of interference is called \u201dfading\u201d.\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010", "category": "general", "metadata": {"vehicle_type": "fzj80", "pdf": "fzj80_fsm_1996", "pages": "213-215", "part": 1}}

For this reason,\nFM signals often seem to gradually disappear or\nfade away as the vehicle goes behind a building or\nother obstruction. This is called \u201dfade out\u201d.\n4.\nCOMPACT DISC PLAYER\nCompact Disc (hereafter called \u201dCD\u201d) Players use a laser beam\npick\u2212up to read the digital signals recorded on the CD and re-\nproduce analog signals of the music, etc. There are 4.7 in.

(8 cm) discs in the CD player.\nHINT:\nNever attempt to disassemble or oil any part of the player unit.\nDo not insert any object other than a disc into the magazine.\nNOTICE:\nCD players use an invisible laser beam which could cause\nhazardous radiation exposure.

In addition to the MIL lighting up when\na malfunction is detected, the applicable Diagnostic\nTrouble Codes (DTC) prescribed by SAE J2012 are\nrecorded in the ECM memory (See page DI\u221213).\nIf the malfunction does not reoccur in 3 trips, the MIL goes off\nbut the DTC remain recorded in the ECM memory.\n\u0002\nTo check the DTC, connect the OBD II scan tool or\nTOYOTA hand\u2212held tester to Data Link Connector\n3 (DLC3) on the vehicle. The OBD II scan tool or\nTOYOTA hand\u2212held tester also enables you to\nerase the DTCs and check freezed frame data and\nvarious forms of engine data (For operating instruc-\ntions, see the OBD II scan tool\u2019s instruction book.).\n\u0002\nDTC include SAE controlled codes and manufac-\nturer controlled codes. SAE controlled codes must\nbe set as prescribed by the SAE, while manufactur-\ner controlled codes can be set freely by the\nmanufacturer within the prescribed limits (See DTC\nchart on page DI\u221213).\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010", "category": "engine", "metadata": {"vehicle_type": "fzj80", "pdf": "fzj80_fsm_1996", "pages": "422-440", "part": 7}}

It also has a check mode\nfor technicians to simulate malfunction symptoms\nand troubleshoot. Most DTC use 2 trip detection\nlogic* to prevent erroneous detection, and ensure\nthorough malfunction detection. By switching the\nECM to check mode when troubleshooting, the\ntechnician can cause the MIL to light up for a mal-\nfunction that is only detected once or momentarily\n(TOYOTA hand\u2212held tester only) (See step 2).\n\u0002\n*2 trip detection logic:\nWhen a logic malfunction is first detected, the mal-\nfunction is temporarily stored in the ECM memory.\nIf the same malfunction is detected again during the\nsecond drive test, this second detection causes the\nMIL to light up.\n\u0002\nThe 2 trip repeats the same mode a 2nd time (How-\never, the IG switch must be turned OFF between the\n1st trip and 2nd trip.).\n\u0002\nFreeze frame data:\nFreeze frame data records the engine condition\nwhen a misfire (DTC P0300 \u2212 P0306) or fuel trim\nmalfunction (DTC P0171, P0172) or other malfunc-\ntion (first malfunction only), is detected.\n\u0002\nBecause freeze frame data records the engine\nconditions  (fuel system, calculator load, engine\ncoolant temperature, fuel trim, engine speed, ve-\nhicle speed, etc.) when the malfunction is detected,\nwhen troubleshooting it is useful for determining\nwhether the vehicle was running or stopped, the en-\ngine warmed up or not, the air\u2212fuel ratio lean or rich,\netc. at the time of the malfunction.\nPriorities for troubleshooting:\nIf troubleshooting priorities for multiple DTCs are given in the\napplicable diagnostic chart,  these should be followed.\nIf no instructions are given troubleshoot DTCs according to the\nfollowing priorities.\n(1)\nDTC other than fuel trim malfunction (DTC P0171,\nP0172), EGR (DTC P0401, P0402), and misfire\n(DTC P0300 \u2212 P0306).\n(2)\nFuel trim malfunction (DTC P0171, P0172), and\nEGR (DTC P0401, P0402).\n(3)\nMisfire (DTC P0300 \u2212 P0306).\n(b)\nCheck the DLC3.\nThe vehicle\u2019s ECM uses V.P.W.

The hot wire air flow meter consists of a platinum hot wire,\nthermistor and a control circuit installed in a plastic housing. The hot wire air flow meter works on the principle\nthat the hot wire and thermistor located in the intake air bypass of the housing detect any changes in the\nintake air temperature.\nThe hot wire is maintained at the set temperature by controlling the current flow through the hot wire. This\ncurrent flow is then measured as the output voltage of the air flow meter.\nThe circuit is constructed so that the platinum hot wire and thermistor provide a bridge circuit, with the power\ntransistor controlled so that the potential of \u201dA\u201d and \u201dB\u201d remains equal to maintain the set temperature.\nDTC No.\nDTC Detecting Condition\nTrouble Area\nP0100\nOpen or short in mass air flow meter circuit with engine\nspeed 4,000 rpm or less.\n\u0002 Open or short in mass air flow meter circuit\n\u0002 Mass air flow meter\n\u0002 ECM\nIf the ECM detects DTC\u201d P0100\u201d it operates the fail safe function, keeping the ignition timing and injection\nvolume constant and marking it possible to drive the vehicle.\nHINT:\nAfter confirming DTC P0100 use the OBD II scan tool or TOYOTA hand\u2212held tester to confirm the mass air\nflow ratio from \u201dCURRENT DATA\u201d.\nMass Air Flow Value (gm/sec.)\nMalfunction\nApprox. 0\n\u0002 Mass air flow meter power source open\n\u0002 VG circuit open or short\n439.0 or more\n\u0002 E21 circuit open \nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010\n\nP22419\nW\nR\u2212Y\nG\nECM\nY\u2212R\nR\nR\nBR\nBattery\nFusible Link\nEFI\nR/B No.2\nEFI Main\nRelay\nY\u2212R\nFL MAIN\nBR\n1\nMass Air Flow\nMeter\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\nF8\n2\n4\n3\nE7\nE5\nE5\nVG\nMRLY\n2\n2\n3\n7\n5\n16\nB+\nE1\nEB\nE21\nEB1\nEA2\n\u2212\nDIAGNOSTICS\nENGINE\nDI\u221221\n1996 LAND CRUISER   (RM451U)\nWIRING DIAGRAM\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010", "category": "general", "metadata": {"vehicle_type": "fzj80", "pdf": "fzj80_fsm_1996", "pages": "444-521", "part": 12}}

Circuit Malfunction\nCIRCUIT DESCRIPTION\nThe intake air temperature sensor is built into the air flow meter\nand senses the intake air temperature.\nA thermistor built in the sensor changes the resistance value\naccording to the intake air temperature. The lower the intake air\ntemperature, the greater the thermistor resistance value, and\nthe higher the intake air temperature, the lower the thermistor\nresistance value (See fig.1).\nThe intake air temperature sensor is connected to the ECM\n(See next page). The 5 V power source voltage in the ECM is\napplied to the intake air temperature sensor from the terminal\nTHA via a resistor R.\nThat is, the resistor R and the intake air temperature sensor are\nconnected in series. When the resistance value of the intake air\ntemperature sensor changes in accordance with changes in the\nintake air temperature, the potential at terminal THA also\nchanges. Based on this signal, the ECM increases the fuel in-\njection volume to improve driveability during cold engine opera-\ntion. \nIf the ECM detects the DTC \u201dP0110\u201d, it operates the fail safe\nfunction in which the intake air temperature is assumed to be\n20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F).\nIntake Air Temp.\n\u00b0C (\u00b0F)\nResistance\n(k\u03a9)\nVoltage\n(V)\n\u221220 (\u22124)\n16.2\n4.3\n0 (32)\n5.9\n3.4\n20 (68)\n2.5\n2.4\n40 (104)\n1.1\n1.4\n60 (140)\n0.6\n0.9\n80 (176)\n0.3\n0.5\n100 (212)\n0.1\n0.2\nDTC No.\nDTC Detecting Condition\nTrouble Area\nP0110\nOpen or short in intake air temp. sensor circuit\n\u0002 Open or short in intake air temp. sensor circuit\n\u0002 Intake air temp. sensor\n\u0002 ECM\nHINT:\nAfter confirming DTC P110 use the OBD II scan tool or TOYOTA hand\u2212held tester to confirm the intake air\ntemp. from \u201dCURRENT DATA\u201d.\nTemp.

This characteristic is used to detect the oxygen concentration in the exhaust\ngas and provide feedback to the computer for control of the air\u2212fuel ratio.\nWhen the air\u2212fuel ratio becomes LEAN, the oxygen concentration in the exhaust increases and the oxygen\nsensor informs the ECM of the LEAN condition (small electromotive force: 0 V).\nWhen the air\u2212fuel ratio is RICHER than the stoichiometric air\u2212fuel ratio the oxygen concentration in the ex-\nhaust gas in reduced and the oxygen sensor informs the ECM of the RICH condition (large electromotive\nforce: 1 V). The ECM judges by the electromotive force from the oxygen sensor whether the air\u2212fuel ratio\nis RICH or LEAN and controls the injection time accordingly. However, if malfunction of the oxygen sensor\ncauses output of abnormal electromotive force, the ECM is unable to perform accurate air\u2212fuel ratio control.\nThe heated oxygen sensors include a heater which heats the zirconia element. The heater is controlled by\nthe ECM. When the intake air volume is low (the temp. of the exhaust gas is low) current flows to the heater\nto heat the sensor for accurate oxygen concentration detection.\nDTC No.\nDTC Detecting Condition\nTrouble Area\nP0125\nAfter the engine is warmed up, heated oxygen sensor (bank 1\nsensor 2) output does not indicate RICH even once when\nconditions (a), (b) and (c) continue for at least 1.5 min.\n(a) Engine speed: 1,500 rpm or more\n(b) Vehicle speed: 40 \u2212 100 km/h (25 \u2212 62 mph)\n(c) Closed throttle position switch: OFF\n\u0002 Open or short in heated oxygen sensor (bank 1 sensor 1)\ncircuit\n\u0002 Heated oxygen sensor (bank1 sensor 1)\nDI5P9\u221202\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010", "category": "general", "metadata": {"vehicle_type": "fzj80", "pdf": "fzj80_fsm_1996", "pages": "444-521", "part": 22}}

Intake air bypassing the throttle valve is directed\nto the IAC valve through a passage. A step motor is built into\nthe IAC valve. It consists of four coils, a magnetic rotor, valve\nshaft and valve. When current flows to the coils due to signals\nfrom the ECM, the rotor turns and moves the valve shaft forward\nor backward, changing the clearance between the valve and\nthe valve seat.

Also, by the counter electromotive force generated when the primary\ncurrent is interrupted, the igniter sends an ignition confirmation signal (IGF) to the ECM.

When the engine starts (STA ON), Tr2 in the ECM is OFF, so battery voltage is\napplied directry to the fuel pump. Fuel pump operates at high speed.\nAfter the engine starts, during idling or light loads, since Tr2 goes ON, power is supplied to the fuel pump\nvia the fuel pump resistor.\nFuel pump operates at low speed.\nDI5PY\u221202\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010\n\nS02978\nBattery\nFL MAIN\nFL AM2\nF7\nE8\n1\n1\nEA2\n3\nW\u2212R\nW\u2212R\nW\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nEFI Main Relay\n1\n2\n3\n4\nR\u2212Y\nY\u2212R\nY\u2212R\nEB1\nIH1\n22\nY\nR\n2\n1\n4\n3\nIG Switch\n6\n11\nB\u2212R\nB\u2212L\nCircuit Opening\nRelay\nFuse Block\nR\u2212G\nR\u2212W\n5\nFuel Pump\nRelay\n1\n2\n3\n1\n2\nFuel Pump\nResister\nR\u2212B\nR\u2212B\nID2\nBO1\n13\n3\n3\n6\nFuel Pump\nW\u2212B\n5\nBO1\nW\u2212B\nW\u2212R\nR\u2212W\nIH1\n17\nE7\nE7\nE4\n3\n13\n14\nMRLY\nR\nFC\nFPR\nB+\nE01\nE01\nECM\nBF\nEA2\n7\nFusible\nLink\nFEI\nEB\nR\u2212G\nR\u2212W\nR\u2212G\n1\nBR\nR/B No.2\nIGN\nDI\u2212116\n\u2212\nDIAGNOSTICS\nENGINE\n1996 LAND CRUISER   (RM451U)\nWIRING DIAGRAM\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010", "category": "general", "metadata": {"vehicle_type": "fzj80", "pdf": "fzj80_fsm_1996", "pages": "552-553"}}

In addition to the MIL lighting up when\na malfunction is detected, the applicable DTCs pre-\nscribed by SAE J2012 are recorded in the ECM\nmemory (See page DI\u221213).\nIf the malfunction does not occurs in 3 trips, the MIL goes off but\nthe DTCs remain recorded in the ECM memory.\n\u0002\nTo check the DTCs, connect an OBD II scan tool or\nTOYOTA hand\u2212held tester to the DLC3 on the ve-\nhicle. The OBD II scan tool or TOYOTA hand\u2212held\ntester also enables you to erase the DTCs and\ncheck freeze frame data and various forms of en-\ngine data (For operating instructions, see the OBDII\nscan tool\u2019s instruction book).\n\u0002\nDTCs include SAE controlled codes and Manufac-\nturer controlled codes.\nSAE controlled codes must be set as prescribed by\nthe SAE, while Manufacturer controlled codes can\nbe set freely by the manufacturer within the pre-\nscribed limits (See page DI\u2212143).\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010", "category": "general", "metadata": {"vehicle_type": "fzj80", "pdf": "fzj80_fsm_1996", "pages": "554-593", "part": 6}}

The ECM also turns the shift solenoid\nvalve SL OFF at the same time. If both solenoids are malfunction, hydraulic control cannot be done electroni-\ncally and must be done manually.\nManual shifting as shown in the following table must be done (In the case of a short circuit, the ECM stops\nsending current to the short circuited solenoid).\nHINT:\nCheck the shift solenoid valve No. 1 when DTC P0753 is output and check the shift solenoid valve No. 2\nwhen DTC P0758 is output.\nDTC No.\nDTC Detecting Condition\nTrouble Area\nP0753\nP0758\nThe ECM checks for an open or short circuit in the shift sole-\nnoid valves No. 1 and No. 2 circuit when it changes \nThe ECM records DTC P0753 or P0758 if condition (a) or (b) is\ndetected once, but it does not light up MIL \nAfter ECM detects condition (a) or (b) continuously 8 times or\nmore in one\u2212trip, it causes the MIL light up until condition (a) or\n(b) disappears\nAfter that, if the ECM detects condition (a) or (b) once, it starts\nlighting up MIL again\n(a) Solenoid resistance is 8 \u03a9 or less (short circuit) when the\nsolenoid is energized\n(b) Solenoid resistance is 100 k\u03a9 or more (open circuit) when\nthe solenoid is not energized\n\u0002 Open or short in shift solenoid valve No. 1/No. 2 circuit\n\u0002 Shift solenoid valve No. 1/No. 2\n\u0002 ECM\nDI5KO\u221202\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010", "category": "general", "metadata": {"vehicle_type": "fzj80", "pdf": "fzj80_fsm_1996", "pages": "594-598", "part": 1}}

Failure to carry out service operations in the correct sequence could cause the\nSRS to unexpectedly deploy during servicing, possibly leading to a serious accident. Further,\nif a mistake is made in servicing the SRS, it is possible the SRS may fail to operate when re-\nquired. Before performing servicing (including removal or installation of parts, inspection or\nreplacement), be sure to read the following items carefully, then follow the correct procedure\ndescribed in the repair manual.\n\u0002\nMalfunction symptoms of the SRS are difficult to confirm, so the DTCs become the most impor-\ntant source of information when troubleshooting. When troubleshooting the SRS, always in-\nspect the DTCs before disconnecting the battery.\n\u0002\nEven in cases of a minor collision where the SRS does not deploy, the steering wheel pad, front\npassenger airbag assembly, and airbag sensor assembly should be inspected (See pages \nRS\u22129, RS\u221223 and RS\u221234)\n\u0002\nNever use SRS parts from another vehicle. When replacing parts, replace them with new parts.\n\u0002\nNever disassemble and repair the steering wheel pad, front passenger airbag assembly, or air-\nbag sensor assembly in order to reuse it.\n\u0002\nIf the steering wheel pad, front passenger airbag assembly or airbag sensor assembly have\nbeen dropped, or if there are cracks, dents or other defects in the case, bracket or connector,\nreplace them with new ones.\n\u0002\nUse a volt/ohmmeter with high impedance (10 k\u03a9/V minimum) for troubleshooting the system\u2019s\nelectrical circuits.\n\u0002\nInformation labels are attached to the periphery of the SRS components. Follow the instruc-\ntions on the notices.\n\u0002\nAfter work on the SRS is completed, check the SRS warning light (See page DI\u2212240).\n\u0002\nIf the vehicle is equipped with a mobile communication system, refer to the precaution in the\nIN section.\nCAUTION:\n\u0002\nWork must be started after 90 seconds from the time the ignition switch is turned to the \u201dLOCK\u201d\nposition and the negative (\u2212) terminal cable is disconnected from the battery.\n(The SRS is equipped with a back\u2212up power source so that if work is started within 90 seconds\nof disconnecting the negative (\u2212) terminal cable of the battery, the SRS may be deployed.)\n\u0002\nWhen the negative (\u2212) terminal cable is disconnected from the battery, the memory of the clock\nand audio system will be canceled. So before starting work, make a record of the contents mem-\norized in the audio memory system. When work is finished, reset the audio systems as they\nwere before and adjust the clock. To avoid erasing the memory of each memory system, never\nuse a back\u2212up power supply from outside the vehicle.\n\u0002\nBefore repairs, remove the airbag sensor if shocks are likely to be applied to the sensor during\nrepairs.\n\u0002\nDo not expose the steering wheel pad, front passenger airbag assembly, or airbag sensor as-\nsembly directly to hot air or flames.\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nBrought to you by BirfMark\nVersion 1.11 - 03/16/2010", "category": "general", "metadata": {"vehicle_type": "fzj80", "pdf": "fzj80_fsm_1996", "pages": "1025-1063", "part": 1}}
